# Matlab-Projects
A collection of games coded in Matlab. They are created for fun and curiosity, so don't expect the next Matlab GTA VI ;)

At the moment, the following games are available:

## Battleship
Offline version of the famous board game. LAN multiplayer will be available soon (if I can find it in my old, forgotten HDD)

## Chess
Unfinished chess with matrix and numbers instead of board and pieces (great, isn't it?)

## 2048
The game where geeks can take advantage of their knowledge about powers of 2, 
but now written in the best language ever created for writing videogames, Matlab.
